export const ENV_CONFIG = {
	BASE_URL: isProduction ? 'web3pad.xyz' : '192.168.1.43', // ← Replace with your local IP
	CLIENT_PORT: isProduction ? 4444 : 3000,
	SERVER_PORT: isProduction ? 5566 : 3001,
	// ...
};
```

### Adding a New Game

**Step-by-step guide:**

1. **Server-side Logic:**
   - Create game class in `server/games/yourGame.js`
   - Extend from `BaseGame` class
   - Implement `update()` and `handlePlayerInput()` methods
2. **Register Game:**

   - Add to `server/games/index.js`
   - Define game metadata (name, description, player limits, icon)

3. **Client-side UI:**

   - Create `YourGameScreen.tsx` in `client/components/`
   - Create `YourGameMobileController.tsx` for mobile controls
   - Use PixiJS for game rendering

4. **Routing:**
   - Add game type handler in `client/app/game/[gameType]/page.tsx`

**Current examples:** Check `shooterGame.js`, `raceGame.js`, or `towerDefenceGame.js` for reference implementations.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Game cards not showing

1. Make sure server is running:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/games
   ```

   Should return JSON with games

2. Check browser console (F12) for errors

3. Verify ports are free:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

### Mobile devices not connecting

1. Ensure all devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
2. Check `LOCAL_IP` in `client/env.config.ts`
3. Make sure firewall isn't blocking ports 3000 and 3001
