## Communication Style

## Project Structure

- Check for TypeScript errors before considering work complete
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns

## Specific Rules

- Agent responses MUST be in English only
- No Russian in code, comments, or variable names
- No auto-generated summary documents
- No "changes applied" or "what I did" files
- Focus on writing code, not documenting what you wrote
- Always write code, comments, and descriptions in English

## Documentation Rules

- **DO NOT create *.md files (guides, documentation, tutorials) unless explicitly requested by the user**
- **DO NOT create README files, GUIDE files, SETUP files, or any documentation automatically**
- Only create documentation when user specifically asks for it
- Focus on implementing features, not documenting them
- Code should be self-explanatory with clear comments
