# W3P Project Rules for Cursor IDE

## Language and Localization

- **ALL code comments MUST be in English**
- **ALL variable names, function names, and identifiers MUST be in English**
- **ALL commit messages MUST be in English**
- **ALL documentation MUST be in English**
- User-facing text (UI labels, messages, etc.) should be in Russian
- Keep code and comments separate from UI text

## Communication Style

- **DO NOT create summary files or "what was done" documents**
- **DO NOT generate change logs or progress reports unless explicitly requested**
- Keep responses concise and action-oriented
- Focus on code and implementation, not documentation of changes

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new files in the client
- Use ES6+ features and modern JavaScript patterns
- Follow existing project structure and naming conventions
- Prefer functional components and hooks in React

## Project Structure

- Client code goes in `/client` directory
- Server code goes in `/server` directory
- Shared types and interfaces should be clearly documented
- Keep game logic separate from UI components

## Development Workflow

- Test changes before committing
- Ensure both client and server run without errors
- Check for TypeScript errors before considering work complete
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns

## Specific Rules

- No Russian in code, comments, or variable names
- No auto-generated summary documents
- No "changes applied" or "what I did" files
- Focus on writing code, not documenting what you wrote

## Documentation Rules

- **DO NOT create *.md files (guides, documentation, tutorials) unless explicitly requested by the user**
- **DO NOT create README files, GUIDE files, SETUP files, or any documentation automatically**
- Only create documentation when user specifically asks for it
- Focus on implementing features, not documenting them
- Code should be self-explanatory with clear comments
